# Design Goals

The development of FastCSV is guided by a set of design goals.

- **Performance**: FastCSV is designed to be blazing fast. It is optimized for reading and writing CSV files as quickly
  as possible.
- **Lightweight**: FastCSV is designed to be lightweight. It has no external dependencies and ensures a small memory
  footprint.
- **Compliant**: FastCSV is designed to comply with the CSV
  specification [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180).
- **Robustness**: FastCSV is designed to be robust and reliable. Thoroughly tested, it ensures a high level of
  stability.
- **Simplicity**: FastCSV is designed to be simple and intuitive. It provides a simple API that is easy to use and
  understand.
- **Security**: FastCSV is designed to be secure. Size constraints are enforced to prevent denial of service attacks.
- **Documentation**: FastCSV is designed to be well documented. It offers comprehensive documentation for all features.
- **Maintainability**: FastCSV is designed to be maintainable in order to ensure its longevity, continued development
  and support.

While flexibility and extensibility are important, they are not considered as design goals. They are only considered if
they do not conflict with the design goals listed above.
